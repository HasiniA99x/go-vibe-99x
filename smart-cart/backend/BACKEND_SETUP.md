- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Express.js

## 1. Project Structure

```

│   └── smartcart.db
├── .env
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## 2. Installation

1. Create project directory:
```bash
mkdir -p smart-cart/backend
cd smart-cart/backend
```

2. Initialize project:
```bash
npm init -y
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install express sqlite3 dotenv cors bcryptjs jsonwebtoken typescript ts-node @types/node @types/express @types/sqlite3 @types/cors @types/bcryptjs @types/jsonwebtoken
npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev
```

## 3. Configuration

1. Create TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`):
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

2. Update `package.json` scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/server.js",
    "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "db:init": "ts-node src/config/init-db.ts"
  }
}
```

## 4. API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/register - Register new user
POST /api/auth/login - User login
```

### Products
```
GET /api/products - Get all products
GET /api/products/:id - Get product by ID
POST /api/products - Create product (admin only)
PUT /api/products/:id - Update product (admin only)
DELETE /api/products/:id - Delete product (admin only)
```

### Cart
```
GET /api/cart - Get user's cart
POST /api/cart - Add item to cart
PUT /api/cart/:productId - Update cart item
DELETE /api/cart/:productId - Remove item from cart
```

### Orders
```
POST /api/orders - Create order
GET /api/orders - Get user's orders
```

### Admin
```
GET /api/admin/users - Get all users
PUT /api/admin/users/:id/role - Update user role
GET /api/admin/statistics - Get order statistics
```

## 5. Authentication

The backend uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

1. **Token Generation**
   - Generated on login/register
   - Contains user ID, email, and role
   - Expires in 24 hours

2. **Token Validation**
   - Middleware checks token on protected routes
   - Verifies token signature and expiration
   - Attaches user data to request object

## 6. Error Handling

1. **Global Error Handler**
   - Catches unhandled errors
   - Returns appropriate status codes
   - Logs errors for debugging

2. **Custom Error Responses**
   - 400: Bad Request
   - 401: Unauthorized
   - 403: Forbidden
   - 404: Not Found
   - 500: Internal Server Error

## 7. Security Measures

1. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing
   - Salt rounds: 10
   - Never store plain text

2. **API Security**
   - CORS enabled
   - Rate limiting (optional)
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive data in .env
   - Not committed to version control
   - Example in .env.example

4. **Database Security**
   - File-based permissions
   - Regular backups
   - Access control

## 8. Running the Application

1. Development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 9. Testing the API

1. Using curl:
```bash
# Register
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

2. Using Postman:
