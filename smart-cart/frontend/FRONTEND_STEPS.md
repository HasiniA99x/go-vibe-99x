# SmartCart Frontend Development Steps

## 1. Set up React Components and Services

**Components:**
- `ProductList` (browse products)
- `ProductDetail` (view single product)
- `Cart` (shopping cart)
- `Checkout` (checkout process)
- `AdminDashboard` (admin features)
- `Login` / `Register` (authentication)

**Services/Hooks:**
- `useProducts` (API for products)
- `useCart` (cart logic)
- `useAuth` (login/register/token)
- `useOrders` (checkout/orders)
- `useAdmin` (admin APIs)

## 2. Implement User Interface for Product Browsing
- Use `ProductList` to fetch and display products from `/api/products`
- Use Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for a modern UI
- Add search/filter/sort as needed

## 3. Create Shopping Cart Functionality
- Use `useCart` hook to manage cart state (add, remove, update quantity)
- Display cart contents in the `Cart` component
- Persist cart in local storage or backend for logged-in users

---

## 4. Build Checkout Process
- Use `Checkout` component to collect shipping/payment info
- Use `useOrders` hook to send order to backend (`/api/orders`)
- Show order confirmation

## 5. Develop Admin Dashboard
- Use `AdminDashboard` component
- Fetch users, orders, and products using `useAdmin` hook
- Allow product CRUD, user role management, and view statistics
